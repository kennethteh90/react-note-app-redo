- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Keyboard-aware editing experience

### Error Handling

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **New Screens**: Add to `src/screens/` and update navigation in `App.js`
2. **Components**: Create reusable components in `src/components/`
3. **Utilities**: Add helper functions in `src/utils/`

### Styling

The app uses React Native's StyleSheet API with a consistent design system:
- Primary color: `#6200ee` (Material Design Purple)
- Background: `#f5f5f5`
- Text colors: `#333`, `#666`, `#999`
- Shadows and elevation for depth

### State Management

Currently uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state management. For larger apps, consider:
- Redux for global state
- Context API for theme/user preferences
- React Query for server state

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Metro bundler issues**
   ```bash
   npm start -- --reset-cache
   ```
